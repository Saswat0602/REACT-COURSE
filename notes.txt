--> render() mthod is the backbone of class based component we cant write class based component without render method

--> passing data from parent component to child we used props 
-->  props drilling 
props are a way to pass data between different levels/components without having direct reference.
we can use this technique when there are many layers involved with complex hierarchy.


*************************************************
-->there is two layer in react ui layer and data layer
--> both work in sync
1. UI Layer: React js library which helps us create components, manage state of our application etc.
2. Data Layer : It's responsible for fetching the required information or sending it back to server


Any component in app can use use useContext
useContext hook gives access to context object created using createContext() method



________REDUX__________
Itâ€™s an open-source JavaScript library that provides a predictable store for managing application state across
redux provides an architecture that allows you to write applications that behave consistently, run in different environments.
redux provides an architecture that allows you to have predictable state management across your entire app.
It makes managing large applications easier by providing tools like action creators, reducers, middleware,

--> Instead of use many useContext we can use redux


REDUX - STORE --> It like a big objcet.
--> It hav many section 
-->all component can access redux store.
-->component can not directly modify the redux store.
-->there is many slice in store.
-->we use  *reducer* function to chnge or modify the slice in the store.
-->we  use *selector* to read data from redux store.
-->selector is hook(function)--useSelector
--> use of selector is known as subscribe to the store.
